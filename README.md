# Fluidtester

Fluidtester is used to test the webpage responsiveness with rest the selected device. 

The developers/QA normally test the webpage responsiveness by changing the window's dimensions,
many of them might have used chrome plugin for testing the responsiveness of the webpage but the limitation of the plugin is that we have to manually adjust the screen dimension, that is quite a difficult task  now a days market is flooded with different devices and with different dimensions, is there any way to simplify
this responsiveness testing ? the answer to this question is fluid tester.

We have support a set of devices majority of the people using.
